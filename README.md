The aim of this challenge is to build an image classification model for a satellite image dataset consisting of 6 classes. 
Dataset consists of varied dimension satellite images. 
The dataset is divided into two folders named train(for training) and test (for prediction). 
The zip also contains two CSV files, the format of the train CSV file is self-explanatory.

You can use an ensemble of multiple models to improve results. 
The image size varies and you will have to find a strategy to train a model that will be giving a good accuracy. 
Apart from the test accuracy, the creativity of your solution (which includes augmentation techniques, ensemble method, handling image size variation, loss function) 
will also be evaluated by the reviewing team.

The 6 classes contained in the dataset are:

Adhered
Concrete
Plastic & fabric
Steel
Shingle
Ballasted
